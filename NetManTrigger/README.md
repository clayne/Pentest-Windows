# NetMan Trigger

Simply by enumerating network interfaces, this code snippet can trigger the __NetMan__ service and force it to load the `wlanhlp.dll` or `wlanapi.dll` DLL (depending on the version of Windows).

This behavior is benign on workstations, but may result in a __Ghost DLL Hijacking__ on servers because these DLLs do not exist by default. It goes without saying that at least one entry in the system's `%PATH%` must be writable for this trick to be of any use.

This is discussed in more detail in this [blog post](https://itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking/).
